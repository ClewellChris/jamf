<h1 align="center">Jamf Endpoint Hardening</h1> 

<p>In an effort to better mature our endpoint posture as we began to bring on WindowsOS we set out to utilize Jamf to better protect our internal data as well as our users during their day-to-day tasks.  Our work consisted of utilizing built-in configuration profiles from Jamf as well as a number of custom bash scripts and custom configuration profiles to harden all the areas we found to be dangerous. While we utilzied mostly internal resources I am hoping to find time to implement MacOS Security Compliance Project audit tools and also updates for future versions of MacOS<p>

<br>
<p>Through this repo I am going to keep track of the updates we made to get the foundation we are at now and the steps we'll take to continue to adapt to the changing landscape<p>
