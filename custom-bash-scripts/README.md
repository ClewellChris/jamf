<p>While there are a great many changes and configurations that can be implemented using the Jamf Pro UI there are some limitations with System Settings or implementing custom settings on 3rd Party Applications. Additionally, there are needs for reporting on which users are not in compliance.  Using bash scripts and smart groups you can pinpoint your fixes at only the users who need it and not burden all your users<p>
