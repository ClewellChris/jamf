# 2.12.2 Ensure Guest Access to Shared Folders Is Disabled
# (Automated)
# Profile Applicability:
# â€¢ Level 1

# Description:

# Allowing guests to connect to shared folders enables users to access selected shared
# folders and their contents from different computers on a network.

# Rationale:

# Not allowing guests to connect to shared folders mitigates the risk of an untrusted user
# doing basic reconnaissance and possibly using privilege escalation attacks to take
# control of the system.

# Impact:

# Unauthorized users could access shared files on the system.
