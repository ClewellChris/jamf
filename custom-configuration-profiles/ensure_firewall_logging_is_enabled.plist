3.6 Ensure Firewall Logging Is Enabled and Configured
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:
â€¢ Level 1

Description:

The socketfilter Firewall is what is used when the Firewall is turned on in the Security &
Privacy Preference Pane. In order to appropriately monitor what access is allowed and
denied, logging must be enabled. The logging level must be set to "detailed" to be
useful in monitoring connection attempts that the firewall detects. Throttled login is not
sufficient for examining Firewall connection attempts.
In-depth log monitoring on macOS may require changes to the "Enable-Private-Data"
key in SystemLogging.System to ensure more complete logging.
Reviewing macOS Unified Logs

Rationale:

In order to troubleshoot the successes and failures of a Firewall, detailed logging should
be enabled.

Impact:

Detailed logging may result in excessive storage.
