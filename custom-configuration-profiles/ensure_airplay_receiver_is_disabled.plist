2.3.1.2 Ensure AirPlay Receiver Is Disabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:
â€¢ Level 1
Description:

In macOS Monterey (12.0), Apple has added the capability to share content from
another Apple device to the screen of a host Mac. While there are many valuable uses
of this capability, such sharing on a standard Mac user workstation should be enabled
ad hoc as required rather than allowing a continuous sharing service. The feature can
be restricted by Apple ID or network and is configured to use by accepting the
connection on the Mac. Part of the concern is frequent connection requests may
function as a denial-of-service and access control limits may provide too much
information to an attacker.

Rationale:

This capability appears very useful for kiosk and shared work spaces. The ability to
allow by network could be especially useful on segregated guest networks where
visitors could share their screens on computers with bigger monitors, including
computers connected to projectors.

Impact:

Turning off AirPlay sharing by default will not allow users to share without turning the
service on. The service should be enable as needed rather than left on.
