2.3.2.1 Ensure Set Time and Date Automatically Is Enabled
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:
â€¢ Level 1

Description:

Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation,
modification dates, and log entries.

Note: If your organization has internal time servers, enter them here. Enterprise mobile
devices may need to use a mix of internal and external time servers. If multiple servers
are required, use the Date & Time System Preference with each server separated by a
space.

Additional Note: The default Apple time server is time.apple.com. Variations include
time.euro.apple.com. While it is certainly more efficient to use internal time servers,
there is no reason to block access to global Apple time servers or to add a
time.apple.com alias to internal DNS records. There are no reports that Apple gathers
any information from NTP synchronization, as the computers already phone home to
Apple for Apple services including iCloud use and software updates. Best practice is to
allow DNS resolution to an authoritative time service for time.apple.com, preferably to
connect to Apple servers, but local servers are acceptable as well.

Rationale:

Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes.
This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other
features.

Impact:

The timed service will periodically synchronize with named time servers and will make
the computer time more accurate.
