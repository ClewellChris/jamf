1.6 Ensure Install Security Responses and System Files Is
Enabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:
â€¢ Level 1

Description:

Ensure that system and security updates are installed after they are available from
Apple. This setting enables definition updates for XProtect and Gatekeeper. With this
setting in place, new malware and adware that Apple has added to the list of malware or
untrusted software will not execute. These updates do not require reboots or end user
admin rights.
Apple has introduced a security feature that allows for smaller downloads and the
installation of security updates when a reboot is not required. This feature is only
available when the last regular update has already been applied. This feature
emphasizes that a Mac must be up-to-date on patches so that Apple's security tools can
be used to quickly patch when a rapid response is necessary.

Rationale:

Patches need to be applied in a timely manner to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities being
exploited.

Impact:

Unpatched software may be exploited.
