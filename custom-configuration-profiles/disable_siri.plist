2.5.1 Audit Siri Settings (Manual)
Profile Applicability:
â€¢ Level 1

Description:

With macOS 10.12 Sierra, Apple has introduced Siri from iOS to macOS. While there
are data spillage concerns with the use of data-gathering personal assistant software,
the risk here does not seem greater in sending queries to Apple through Siri than in
sending search terms in a browser to Google or Microsoft. While it is possible that Siri
will be used for local actions rather than Internet searches, Siri could, in theory, tell
Apple about confidential Programs and Projects that should not be revealed. This
appears be a usage edge case.
In cases where sensitive or protected data is processed and Siri could expose that
information through assisting a user in navigating their machine, it should be disabled.
Siri does need to phone home to Apple, so it should not be available from air-gapped
networks as part of its requirements.
Most of the use case data published has shown that Siri is a tremendous time saver on
iOS where multiple screens and menus need to be navigated through. Information like
sports scores, weather, movie times, and simple to-do items on existing calendars can
be easily found with Siri. None of the standard use cases should be more risky than
already approved activity.

Rationale:

Where "normal" user activity is already limited, Siri use should be controlled as well.
