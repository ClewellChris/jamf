6.4.1 Ensure Secure Keyboard Entry Terminal.app Is Enabled
(Automated)
Profile Applicability:
â€¢ Level 1

Description:

Secure Keyboard Entry prevents other applications on the system and/or network from
detecting and recording what is typed into Terminal. Unauthorized applications and
malicious code could intercept keystrokes entered in the Terminal.

Rationale:

Enabling Secure Keyboard Entry minimizes the risk of a key logger detecting what is
entered in Terminal.

Impact:

Enabling this in Terminal would prevent an application that is otherwise validly
intercepting keyboard input from intercepting that input in Terminal.app. This could
impact productivity tools.
