2.9.3 Ensure Wake for Network Access Is Disabled (Automated)
Profile Applicability:
• Level 1

Description:

This feature allows the computer to take action when the user is not present and the
computer is in energy saving mode. These tools require FileVault to remain unlocked
and fully rejoin known networks. This macOS feature is meant to allow the computer to
resume activity as needed regardless of physical security controls.
This feature allows other users to be able to access your computer’s shared resources,
such as shared printers or Apple Music playlists, even when your computer is in sleep
mode. In a closed network when only authorized devices could wake a computer, it
could be valuable to wake computers in order to do management push activity. Where
mobile workstations and agents exist, the device will more likely check in to receive
updates when already awake. Mobile devices should not be listening for signals on any
unmanaged network or where untrusted devices exist that could send wake signals.

Rationale:

Disabling this feature mitigates the risk of an attacker remotely waking the system and
gaining access.

Impact:

Management programs like Apple Remote Desktop Administrator use wake-on-LAN to
connect with computers. If turned off, such management programs will not be able to
wake a computer over the LAN. If the wake-on-LAN feature is needed, do not turn off
this feature.
The control to prevent computer sleep has been retired for this version of the
Benchmark. Forcing the computer to stay on and use energy in case a management
push is needed is contrary to most current management processes. Only keep
computers unslept if after hours pushes are required on closed LANs.
